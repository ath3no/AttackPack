# Legion
## What is Legion?
Legion is a GUI scanner using `nmap` and `vulners` behind-the-scenes. It runs several scanning stages + gives you screenshots from display-able ports. Super cool (and seems to be extensible, maybe we should write service plugins for that)

## How do I use Legion?
`sudo legion`
use GUI. Super simple.

## Any documentation on Legion?
[Kali Tools - Legion](https://www.kali.org/tools/legion/)


## Any caveats I should be aware of?
* Legion doesn't always scan all ports, it can miss some ports and cause enumeration-frustration.
	* Real feeling. Really sucks.
