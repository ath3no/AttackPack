# Metasploit
## What is Metasploit?
Metasploit is an exploitation framework, containing ready-made exploits ready to use at the push of a button.

## How do I use Metasploit?
### The ol' fashioned way
* load with `msfconsole`
* search for exploit with `search <keyword>`
* select exploit with `use <number>`
* see config with `show options`
* change options with `set <option> <value>`
* change payload with `set PAYLOAD <payload_path>`
	* find payload with `show payloads`
* run using `run` or `exploit` if you're feeling extra-skiddy.
### If you're feeling even more skiddy

## Any documentation on Metasploit?
[[Rapid7]]

## Any caveats I should be aware of?
* As nice as it is, Metasploit is not a magic bullet - sometimes it's not going to work and you're going to have to exploit something manually.
