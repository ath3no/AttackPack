# Armitage
## What is Armitage?
Armitage is a GUI for [[Metasploit]]. That simple.

## How do I use Armitage?
WinKey -> Armitage -> enter sudo password.
GUI is pretty straightforward. I might expand this later.

## Any documentation on Armitage?

## Any caveats I should be aware of?
* Just like every GUI wrapper, sometimes it's going to be *too* streamlined, and custom exploits are going to be a bit difficult.
	* If something goes wrong, you can always use the `Console` tab.
* Armitage has not been maintained since 2016, there *is* a 2021 fork (in downloads now + [here](https://github.com/redcanari/armitage)), it's better but not perfect. watch out for:
	* downloads are finnicky and can kill your meterpreter
	* ps list doesn't work
