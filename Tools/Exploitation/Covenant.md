# Covenant
## What is Covenant?
Covenant is an open source C2 Framework written in .NET. It supports its own implants called Grunt (for Windows machines) and Brute (cross-platform implant), together with automated task management and collaborative support.

## How do I use Covenant?
* using `dotnet`
	* Clone the github project
	* navigate to `REPO/Covenant`
	* run `dotnet run`
	* connect to the server
* using `docker`
	* download the container using the github readme
	* run it

## Any documentation on Covenant?
[Covenant GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki)

## Any caveats I should be aware of?
* The implant generator doesn't work very well, with no indicators of tasks being done and the download button doesn't work (at least on Firefox)
