# Wildcard Exploitation
## What is Wildcard Exploitation?
Wildcards are powerful things. If a linux variable in a bash executable is unquoted (for example, `$VAR` and not `"$VAR"`) you can use wildcards to bypass checks!

## What does Wildcard Exploitation give me?
* Password bypass
* bruteforcing
* PE
* RCE
* who knows!

## Any documentation on Wildcard Exploitation?
[Wildcard Exploits](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/)

## How do I verify that a target is vulnerable?
Variable in bash script is unquoted

## How do I use Wildcard Exploitation?
Enter a `*` to see if it acts different.
Then you can bruteforce like in Hollywood movies - one char at a time, followed by a `*`
done :)
