# AttackPack
Welcome to AttackPack!

This is a documentation project, used to document every service I (and others) have hacked, and - more importantly - how to hack it again.

This is meant to make future attacks easier.

## Structure
AttackPack is built to be conveinient while using Obsidian's Graph View. Seriously, go look at that. It's great.

It's divided into categories. A category is a broad subject - books, computer programs, articles, templates, resources...

Each category has a directory with the same name, which lists links to every contained resource and more directories.

A resource can be a book, an article, a website, a hackable service... any piece of info.

AttackPack.md is the main directory, and it links the largest categories. Check it out to see how directories are sturctured.

### To add a new entry:
* Go to the most specific directory your entry belongs to
* Add subdirectories as you wish
* Create the entry
* Use the template that fits the entry (`Ctrl-P`, type "Template", select "Insert Template" and pick the template you want)
* Fill in the entry
* Done!
