# AttackPack
Welcome to AttackPack!

This is a documentation project, used to document every service I (and others) have hacked, and - more importantly - how to hack it again.

This is meant to make future attacks easier.

## Structure
AttackPack is built to be conveinient while using Obsidian's Graph View. Seriously, go look at that. It's great.

It's divided into categories. A category is a broad subject - books, computer programs, articles, templates, resources...

Each category has a directory with the same name, which lists links to every contained resource and more directories.

A resource can be a book, an article, a website, a hackable service... any piece of info.

This file is the main directory, and it links the largest categories like this:

## Directory
[[Books]]
[[Services]]
[[Internet Resources]]
[[Tools]]
[[Vulnerabilities]]
